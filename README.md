# Queue
The Queue Kapp is a work management system build on Kinetic Request CE. Work items can be tasks, approvals, cases or any combination that make up a fulfillment process. Queue helps organize your todo's into lists of work to be completed, and allows you to spawn off ad-hoc work items, and invite others to work on an item with you.

### Form Type Reference
Form Types are used to group forms within Kinetic Request CE. The following Form Types have been defined within the Queue app.
1. Automated -- Automated Forms are forms that are created via workflow (Kinetic Task Processes). These forms do not show up when clicking the "Create New Task" button, or when creating a new sub-task as they are designed to be created via workflow.
2. Task -- Forms of type `Task` will show up when creating a new Task from within the Queue App. These forms are also able to be subtasks.
3. Subtask -- Forms of type `Subtask` will only show up when creating a Subtask from a parent Task.
4. Template -- Forms of type `Template` are used for creating new Tasks within the Queue System, and are configured with all required fields.
* All Tasks are Subtasks, but Subtasks are not Tasks


### Attribute Reference
Attributes in Kinetic Request CE are like variables that can be tied to any object within the application. For example, a Kapp can have an attribute called "Icon" which dictates what Icon should display when referencing the Kapp within the User Interface. Below is a listing of all attributes and what they control within the Queue Kapp.

Certain attributes (noted below with `**`) have been defined at the Space, Kapp and Form levels. This means, that if the attribute exists at the `Form` level, it will override the attribute value set at the `Kapp` level...etc. The Space is the "highest" level, and then "Kapp" then "Form".
