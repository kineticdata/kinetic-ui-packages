# Services
The Services Kapp is designed to be a place for internal or external users you request things from teams within an organization. This is also where a user can go to review or follow-up on existing requests.

## Kapp Configuration References
The Services Application leverages different type of Kinetic Request CE configurations for driving logic within the App. These configurations have been outlined below.

### Form Fields Reference
Field Name  | Field Type | Description
----------  | ----------- | -----------
Discussion Id  | Text | Stores the ID of the tasks related Discussion
Observing Teams | Checkbox | Used to control security and which teams are able to view the Task
Observing Individuals | Checkbox | Used to control security and which users are able to view the Task

### Form Type Reference
Form Types are used to group forms within Kinetic Request CE. The following Form Types have been defined within the Services app.
1. Service -- Any form that is requestable within the app. These forms will show up in Categories and submissions for these forms will be displayed in the `My Requests` area of the app.
2. Template -- Template forms can be used as a starting place for creating new services. Once you `Clone` a template, change the Type to `Service` and set it's status to `Active` for it to show up in the portal.
3. Utlitiy -- Utility Type forms are used for console activities and will not be displayed as *Requestable* or show up in the `My Requests` area of the app. Common utility forms are `Comment` to comment on something previously submitted...etc.

### Attribute Reference
Attributes in Kinetic Request CE are like variables that can be tied to any object within the application. For example, a Kapp can have an attribute called "Icon" which dictates what Icon should display when referencing the Kapp within the User Interface. Below is a listing of all attributes and what they control within the Services Kapp.

Certain attributes (noted below with `**`) have been defined at the Space, Kapp and Form levels. This means, that if the attribute exists at the `Form` level, it will override the attribute value set at the `Kapp` level...etc. The Space is the "highest" level, and then "Kapp" then "Form".
